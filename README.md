# Project GPrT Global Update Reqs.
In order to have your changes to GPrT be uploaded globally, they must meet certain requirements.
### Format
Though a specific code format is not required, all submissions must be labeled as - 
"Copy of GPrT.ipynb" and have semi-detailed explanations of any changes. 

If one or more library is added throughout your editing process,  link all of the documentations in a text snippet at the very top of your copy.
### Necessities:
- Debugging
- Training ([SFTTrainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/sft_trainer))
- Adaptation ([#PEFT ](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/quicktour))
- Performance/Speed Improvements
- Dataset Additions ([Datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/quickstart))
### Open To Ideas
I'm not going to turn down every submission that doesn't meet these requirements. 

Send your submission to Project GPrT, and if it doesn't meet any of the requirements, simply explain how it improves the project.
